# Sign Language Detection

**Real-time recognition of sign language gestures using computer vision and deep learning.**

---


## Project Overview
• Developed a real-time sign language recognition system to improve accessibility for differently-abled users.
• Utilized OpenCV for hand gesture detection, feature extraction, and image preprocessing.
• Trained and optimized a Random Forest model to classify gestures into corresponding letters/words with good
accuracy.
• Implemented a simple UI to display recognized signs, demonstrating human-computer interaction.
• Strengthened expertise in machine learning, computer vision, and applied AI for accessibility solutions.
